Some helping test files and scripts for the FontPro package:

* accentpost*: print letters with math accent to test their
  positioning

* makeall_2v.sh: run the FontPro scripts for two different otf font
  versions of different weights/cuts of the same font. The script and
  the patch MinionProv2.patch is written for MinionPro and two medium
  cuts otf version 002.000 and the rest version 001.000. Both have to
  be modified to the specific needs.
